When a workflow failed, see if there is an attached artifact with a name that ends with `.patch`, and try to apply it on the branch, in a new commit.

### Functionality Details

This module automates the process of applying patch files generated by CI workflows. When a workflow fails and produces a `.patch` artifact, the module will:

- Download the `.patch` artifact from the failed workflow run.
- Attempt to apply the patch to the current branch.
- Commit the changes with a message based on the patch filename or a default message.
- Push the commit to the pull request branch, allowing the workflow to re-run with the proposed fix.

This helps contributors and maintainers quickly test and apply automated fixes suggested by CI jobs.

### Usage in the workflow

```yaml
on:
  pull-request:

jobs:
  <name>:
    steps:
      ...
      - run: git diff --exit-code --patch > diff.patch
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: <commit_message>.patch
          path: diff.patch
          retention-days: 1
        if: failure()
```

### Usage Notes

- Ensure the workflow produces a valid `.patch` file as an artifact on failure.
- The module will only attempt to apply patches if the artifact is present and can be cleanly applied.
- Review the resulting commit to ensure the patch does not introduce unintended changes.
